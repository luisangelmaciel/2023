    <h1>Hmm... What is this?</h1>
    <p><strong>This is a simple copy-paste notification, with a couple of effects. You can test it by copying some of this text.</strong></p>
    <p>When visitors <strong>copy</strong> something from your website, they get a kind message asking them to remember to mention your website if they <strong>paste</strong> the article on their own.</p>
    <p>That's all. Just a kind reminder. It uses <strong>Session Storage</strong> to avoid spamming the visitor with messages in case they copy <strong>more than one</strong> article. This means that the message will show <strong>once</strong> every time
      they visit your website and try to copy. You can also use Local Storage if you want to show the message only once, <strong>untill the visitors reset</strong> it with a cleaner or using their browser cleaning tools.</p>
    <p>This <strong>does not</strong> protect your from people copying or stealing your content. It is just a friendly message to remind them to give you some credit.</p>
