# flowText - a function to add flowing text to SVG

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/qBMbQwW](https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/qBMbQwW).

We are used to text automatically flowing inside a HTML container. In SVG text cannot do that automatically. You need to "help" SVG by adding a number of TEXT elements.
This pen uses a function I have create called flowText. It will create something looking like text flow inside a SVG element.
The flowText function is also to be found as a gist on github: https://gist.github.com/netsi1964/00a384b1626fad0f467b81cb0fcba435
