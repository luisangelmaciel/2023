A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/ZEMByWG](https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/ZEMByWG).

A fun little pure-CSS experiment to replicate the effect seen in the opening sequnce of World War Z.

NOTE: Will only work with modern browsers that support CSS 3D transform, animation, webkit filters and vh/vw units.
