# Materialize + Angular Search and Filter Responsive Table with pagination

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/YzjZazM](https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/YzjZazM).

A table that uses Materialize http://materializecss.com/ and Angular.js.

This was used with PHP and mySQL on my local WAMP server.  I may update functions to use JSON shortly.
