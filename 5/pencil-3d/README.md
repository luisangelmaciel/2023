# Pencil 3D

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/markmanx01/pen/yJJxRj](https://codepen.io/markmanx01/pen/yJJxRj).

I was interested to see how a Material design inspired UI  could be enhanced with a 3D object, in this case the pencil is rendered as a 3D object, but still manages to look like it fits in with the flat style.  

The shadow and sketch are rendered on a separate 2D canvas (using paper.js vector graphics library), while the pencil is rendered on it's own canvas with THREE.js.
