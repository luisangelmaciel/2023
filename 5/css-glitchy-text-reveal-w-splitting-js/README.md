# CSS Glitchy Text Reveal w/ Splitting.js ðŸ˜Ž

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/XWqePWB](https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/XWqePWB).

Another example of scoped CSS variables ðŸ’ª

This time for dynamic text animation. This could be done with only CSS but Splitting.js is saving me a bunch of time here ðŸ˜…

Enjoy!
