# CodePen Dashboard feedback

Ok, naming things is hard, so if any if the namings 
is weird, I'll happily attach some screenshots.

## TL;DR
_Love it. Probably my new browser startup page. Only a 
few issues and a couple of compliments._

## General
1. Would love to see the **profile switcher** working!
  Having multiple accounts on CodePen and using 
	different login methods, so switching is kinda hard
1. Love the loading/fade-in **transition** for pens in the 
  overview. Would be nice to have that everywhere
1. Finally an overview of *all* pens that I've done
  recently. Wasn't aware that I wanted such a feature,
	but sometimes I couldn't remember if some recent
	pen was private or public, and now I don't have 
	to click in a couple of places anymore
1. **Affordability** of all buttons, form elements etc. 
  is great. Working on a laptop's touchpad is way
	easy. I dabble around a lot in CodePen when I have
	a little spare time, so always just on the laptop,
	no mouse or extra keyboard. Affordability is
	important for me.
1. After browsing it for a while, it feels *so* much
  **faster** than the other profile view that I'm pretty
	sure that this will be my default 
	**find-my-own-stuff section**
	

## Dash content

### Filters and Pen grid
1. Would be nice to be able to select more than one
  option, like I want to see my public and private
	pens, but nothing else. _Not a huge issue, because 
	I hardly fork or create templates_
1. The same actually for Tags. That one would be a
  little cooler, although it'll start to look like
	a Collection. Tough call.
1. The filter for live preview/screenshot overlaps
  the _sort by_ filter: [Screenshot](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/5175/Screen%20Shot%202017-08-15%20at%2022.00.21.png)
1. Been thinking about the tags and other things,
  but not quite sure where the line between custom
	view and Collection would be. Maybe it's up to me
	as a user, or maybe you want to give an option I don't
	quite understand
1. Not really sure why there's a difference between
  _view_ and _search_. For me it could be one extra
	text field in the filter block
	
### Sidebar
1. Looks a bit wide on my 2012 13" MB Air ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
1. Liking the affordability of the large buttons for 
  the filters


## Header
1. It's nice to have a quick access link in the header 
  to go to my own stuff, without having to click the 
	profile dropdown

### Profile dropdown
1. It's waaaay shorter and waaay more useful this way
1. Like that the settings is now more clear


## P.S.
Great job on the feature toggle. Big time fan of the podcast.
