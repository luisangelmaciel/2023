<h1>CodePen Dashboard feedback</h1>
<p>Ok, naming things is hard, so if any if the namings<br>
is weird, I'll happily attach some screenshots.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p><em>Love it. Probably my new browser startup page. Only a<br>
few issues and a couple of compliments.</em></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<ol>
<li>Would love to see the <strong>profile switcher</strong> working!<br>
Having multiple accounts on CodePen and using<br>
different login methods, so switching is kinda hard</li>
<li>Love the loading/fade-in <strong>transition</strong> for pens in the<br>
overview. Would be nice to have that everywhere</li>
<li>Finally an overview of <em>all</em> pens that I've done<br>
recently. Wasn't aware that I wanted such a feature,<br>
but sometimes I couldn't remember if some recent<br>
pen was private or public, and now I don't have<br>
to click in a couple of places anymore</li>
<li><strong>Affordability</strong> of all buttons, form elements etc.<br>
is great. Working on a laptop's touchpad is way<br>
easy. I dabble around a lot in CodePen when I have<br>
a little spare time, so always just on the laptop,<br>
no mouse or extra keyboard. Affordability is<br>
important for me.</li>
<li>After browsing it for a while, it feels <em>so</em> much<br>
<strong>faster</strong> than the other profile view that I'm pretty<br>
sure that this will be my default<br>
<strong>find-my-own-stuff section</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Dash content</h2>
<h3>Filters and Pen grid</h3>
<ol>
<li>Would be nice to be able to select more than one<br>
option, like I want to see my public and private<br>
pens, but nothing else. <em>Not a huge issue, because<br>
I hardly fork or create templates</em></li>
<li>The same actually for Tags. That one would be a<br>
little cooler, although it'll start to look like<br>
a Collection. Tough call.</li>
<li>The filter for live preview/screenshot overlaps<br>
the <em>sort by</em> filter: <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/5175/Screen%20Shot%202017-08-15%20at%2022.00.21.png">Screenshot</a></li>
<li>Been thinking about the tags and other things,<br>
but not quite sure where the line between custom<br>
view and Collection would be. Maybe it's up to me<br>
as a user, or maybe you want to give an option I don't<br>
quite understand</li>
<li>Not really sure why there's a difference between<br>
<em>view</em> and <em>search</em>. For me it could be one extra<br>
text field in the filter block</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sidebar</h3>
<ol>
<li>Looks a bit wide on my 2012 13&quot; MB Air ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
<li>Liking the affordability of the large buttons for<br>
the filters</li>
</ol>
<h2>Header</h2>
<ol>
<li>It's nice to have a quick access link in the header<br>
to go to my own stuff, without having to click the<br>
profile dropdown</li>
</ol>
<h3>Profile dropdown</h3>
<ol>
<li>It's waaaay shorter and waaay more useful this way</li>
<li>Like that the settings is now more clear</li>
</ol>
<h2>P.S.</h2>
<p>Great job on the feature toggle. Big time fan of the podcast.</p>
