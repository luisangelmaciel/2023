# Emojibox
## Checkbox with emojis (without JS)
Create more expressive checkboxes with emojis. They combine the simplicity of checkboxes for the user with the expressiveness of emojis.

It makes use of checkbox and radio button to create a binary or non-binary selection. Animations are done with CSS transitions.

Meant as a tech demo / fun project. You may want to reconsider using it actually in production.
