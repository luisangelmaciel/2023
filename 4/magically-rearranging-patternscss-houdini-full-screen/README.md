# Magically Rearranging Patterns - CSS Houdini âœ¨full screen

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/vYzgYLW](https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/vYzgYLW).

In this pen, I am using the CSS Paint API to create generative patterns that rearrange and resize themselves as the viewport changes. Pretty interesting I think! A very different type of responsiveness.
