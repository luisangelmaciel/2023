# Moving things around with Velocity.js

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/KKxNqaP](https://codepen.io/luisangelmaciel/pen/KKxNqaP).

I'm moving around a whole bunch of elements with Julian Shapiro's Velocity.js. It's running pretty well on my Chrome at anywhere between 60 - 48 frames per second, impressive :)

It took around 4 hours to bang this out after first looking at the documentation, pretty easy to use if you are already a jQuery user. http://julian.com/research/velocity/

No markup because why select when you can create right?

*** I should add that this sort of thing (animation sequence) isn't really what Velocity.js was built for, but I just wanted to crank up the elements/intensity to see how the browser handled it. Incorporating Velocity.js in to your average UI transitions/animations should be a dream :)
